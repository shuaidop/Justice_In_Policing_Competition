# Project Discription from kaggle:

How do you measure justice? And how do you solve the problem of racism in policing? We look for factors that drive racial disparities in policing by analyzing census and police department deployment data. The ultimate goal is to inform police agencies where they can make improvements by identifying deployment areas where racial disparities exist and are not explainable by crime rates and poverty levels.

Our biggest challenge is automating the combination of police data, census-level data, and other socioeconomic factors. Shapefiles are unusual and messy -- which makes it difficult to, for instance, generate maps of police behavior with precinct boundary layers mixed with census layers. Police incident data are also very difficult to normalize and standardize across departments since there are no federal standards for data collection..

Main Prize Track submissions will be judged based on the following general criteria:

Performance - How well does the solution combine shapefiles and census data? How much manual effort is needed? CPE will not be able to live-test every submission, so a strong entry will be able to automate using shape files with different projections and clearly articulate why it is effective at tackling the problem.

Accuracy - Does the solution provide reliable and accurate analysis? How well does it match census-level demographics to police deployment areas?

Approachability - The best solutions should use best coding practices and have useful comments. Plots and graphs should should be self-explanatory. CPE might use your work to explain to stakeholders where to take action,so the results of your solution should be developed for an audience of law enforcement professionals and public officials.
